### Contributions

Want to contribute or fix something? Great!

Open a PR as per the [kag-base PR guidelines](https://github.com/transhumandesign/kag-base/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-process).

If you add a mod, it is recommended to also add an entry in [the mod list](https://github.com/transhumandesign/kag-modded-server-mods/blob/master/mod_list.md) for easy integration.

### License

The original mods are distributed in the form freely distributed from servers hosting them. As none of the mods provide a clear licensing document, we have assumed "public domain" is as close as we'll get. This is legally problematic in some areas, and MIT would be preferred. This requires assent from the authors to retroactively apply.

If you are the author of the mod, feel free to add specific licensing within the mod folder, or to request their removal at your choice.

### Updating the Server

The official modded server must be manually updated. It does not automatically pull from this repository, and as such changes to this repository will not be immediately reflected on the official modded server.

Getting in touch with the developers via discord is likely the best way to get changes through.
