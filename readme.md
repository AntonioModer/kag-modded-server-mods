### What's This?

This repository holds the mods used on the King Arthur's Gold Official Modded Server (OMS).

### Contributions

Want to contribute a mod or fix something in an existing mod? Great!

Open a PR as per the [kag-base PR guidelines](https://github.com/transhumandesign/kag-base/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-process).

If you add a mod, it is recommended to also add an entry in [the mod list](https://github.com/transhumandesign/kag-modded-server-mods/blob/master/mod_list.md) for easy integration.

If you fix something in a mod, please be respectful of the mod's creator. Compatibility fixes and obvious bug fixes are welcome - but for balance or design changes, you should get in touch with the author.

### License

The original mods are distributed in the form freely distributed from servers hosting them. As none of the mods provide a clear licensing document, we have assumed "public domain" is as close as we'll get. This is legally problematic in some areas, and MIT would be preferred. This requires assent from the authors to retroactively apply.

If you are the author of the mod, feel free to add specific licensing within the mod folder, or to request their removal at your choice.

### Updating the Server

The official modded server must be manually updated. It does not automatically pull from this repository at this stage, so changes to this repository will not be _immediately_ reflected on the official modded server.

Getting in touch with the developers via discord is likely the best way to get changes synced through.

### FAQ

**Q:** What kind of mods are permitted to be submitted? Do they have to follow a team vs team format?

**A:** The OMS intended as a mod showcase, and a way for mods that dont have dedicated hosts to get some air time. Mods do not have to follow a team vs team format, but should be suitable for a "general public" audience. Mods with extensive set-up or very fiddly mechanics might not be suitable.

**Q:** Are there any restrictions on round times?

**A:** The mod is currently currently cycled every 3 hours, so that's the maximum sensible time for a single "round".

**Q:** What about mods with persistence?

**A:** The server may be wiped between runs or daily, so persistence is not safe to rely on for OMS mods. This does not _rule out_ sandbox or role play mods, but it does put a limit on how far you can take those concepts. Hosting mods that rely on persistence on your own server is recommended, as is finding a way to work around these limitations for an OMS submission.

**Q:** Can OMS mods uses TCPR?

**A:** Not at this stage.

**Q:** My question isn't answered here, who should I ask?

**A:** Drop your question in `#modding` on the [KAG Official Discord](https://discord.gg/kag) and someone should be able to help you out.
